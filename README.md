# BootSwatchPro
BootSwatch3 with the Google fonts included, and GLYPHICONS replaced with Font Awesome

# Description
BootSwatchPro is an attempt to create the perfect BootSwatch release.

# Changes
1. jQuery dependency dropped and performance enhanced by switching to BootStrap Native.
2. The required Google fonts are hosted in the repo to prevent Google's tracking. 100% Google-free.
3. GLYPHICONS have been completely replaced with Font Awesome 4.7.0 because nobody uses GLYPHICONS.
   (The point here is to prevent the end users from having to waste bandwidth on unused data.)
